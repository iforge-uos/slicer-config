# How to use this vendor bundle

1. Install PrusaSlicer.

2. Run PrusaSlicer, cancel the setup wizard, then close PrusaSlicer.

3. Download the vendor bundle zip from the latest release.

4. Copy the whole vendor folder from the zip into the PrusaSlicer data folder:
  ◦ Windows: C:Users/username/AppData/Roaming/PrusaSlicer
  ◦ Mac: “HDD” ▸ Users ▸ username ▸ Library ▸ Application Support ▸ PrusaSlicer
  ◦ Linux: ~/.config/PrusaSlicer

5. Run PrusaSlicer, and open the Config Wizard.

6. In the “Other Vendors” menu, tick “iForge”, then in the “iForge FFF” menu tick both printers listed, then click “Finish”.

7. All printing profiles should appear in the menus at the top right of the interface.

8. You’re all done!

Do not make any significant changes to these profiles – significantly different
settings from our presets will be rejected from the print queue.

If you have any questions or specific settings you need, please contact the iForge
3D Printing Team directly and we’ll be able to advise and facilitate!
